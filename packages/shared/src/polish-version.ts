/**
 * Polish-21.0.15: single source of truth for the shipped Polish
 * version. Imported by:
 *
 *   - packages/jobs (worker → composite-row metadata + cold-start log)
 *   - apps/web `/api/health` (curl-verifiable freshness endpoint)
 *   - apps/web `/api/version` (dedicated version endpoint)
 *
 * A shared constant creates a cross-package import chain that MUST
 * rebuild every downstream when this file changes — no more "did
 * Vercel actually pick up the packages/jobs change?" guessing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — Polish-21.0.15 root-cause diagnostic
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Job 961281c5 showed `polish_version: null` on a failed RETRY
 * even though Vercel dashboard confirmed the Polish-21.0.14 SHA
 * (1065775) as deployed. Root cause was likely Inngest's
 * documented behavior: retries of an IN-FLIGHT job execute
 * against the function version that was live when the job was
 * FIRST invoked — not the currently-deployed version. So a job
 * originally submitted pre-Polish-21.0.14 keeps running the old
 * code on every retry.
 *
 * Diagnosis protocol for a "did the deploy stick?" report:
 *   1. Curl `/api/health` — reports POLISH_VERSION. If the value
 *      isn't the SHA-in-question, the deploy legitimately didn't
 *      stick (rare — check Vercel build logs).
 *   2. If /api/health shows the expected version but composite
 *      rows still say polish_version=null, submit a NEW job (not
 *      a retry). Inngest's frozen-version-per-job behavior means
 *      retries never see new code.
 *   3. To force an in-flight job onto the new code: cancel it in
 *      the Inngest dashboard and re-invoke — Inngest treats that
 *      as a new submission and picks up the current function
 *      version.

  'Polish-29.0.40 Commit 149 - port the seedance25-ugc-yapper skill playbook into a shared UGC prose prompt builder used by polish29 (Seedance via Dreamina) and polish30 (Omni via Google Flow). The playbook is provider-agnostic on the parts that matter: flowing prose in subject -> action/event -> scene/environment -> visual style -> camera -> sound order (not bracketed HARD-RULES fields), single camera behaviour per clip (no combined moves), positive statements only (never edit/add/remove/change - those reclassify Seedance task type and read as delta cues on any generator), uneven practical light + deep focus + real skin texture as anti-AI-tell language, and a verbatim constraint tail excluding music/subtitles/watermark/logo/visible-phone with the "face stays stable" line. Delivery rate bumped from 135 wpm (2.25 wps) to 180 wpm (3 wps) across both workers - the playbook is explicit that natural TikTok UGC pacing is 3 words per second, and every "still slow" report during the iteration loop was pointing at this. Polish29 dialogue notation switched to Seedance 2.5 curly braces {} (dialogue tokens route directly to TTS verbatim without prose punctuation re-interpretation). Polish30 keeps quoted dialogue since Google Flow Omni router treats {} as literal chars. New shared file packages/jobs/src/lib/ugc-prose-prompt.ts holds the builder so the future kie.ai Seedance 2.5 worker adopts it for free. WORDS_PER_CLIP for polish29 bumped 18 -> 24 to match the new 3 wps target over an 8s clip.';
