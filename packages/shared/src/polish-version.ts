/**
 * Polish-21.0.15: single source of truth for the shipped Polish
 * version. Imported by:
 *
 *   - packages/jobs (worker → composite-row metadata + cold-start log)
 *   - apps/web `/api/health` (curl-verifiable freshness endpoint)
 *   - apps/web `/api/version` (dedicated version endpoint)
 *
 * A shared constant creates a cross-package import chain that MUST
 * rebuild every downstream when this file changes — no more "did
 * Vercel actually pick up the packages/jobs change?" guessing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — Polish-21.0.15 root-cause diagnostic
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Job 961281c5 showed `polish_version: null` on a failed RETRY
 * even though Vercel dashboard confirmed the Polish-21.0.14 SHA
 * (1065775) as deployed. Root cause was likely Inngest's
 * documented behavior: retries of an IN-FLIGHT job execute
 * against the function version that was live when the job was
 * FIRST invoked — not the currently-deployed version. So a job
 * originally submitted pre-Polish-21.0.14 keeps running the old
 * code on every retry.
 *
 * Diagnosis protocol for a "did the deploy stick?" report:
 *   1. Curl `/api/health` — reports POLISH_VERSION. If the value
 *      isn't the SHA-in-question, the deploy legitimately didn't
 *      stick (rare — check Vercel build logs).
 *   2. If /api/health shows the expected version but composite
 *      rows still say polish_version=null, submit a NEW job (not
 *      a retry). Inngest's frozen-version-per-job behavior means
 *      retries never see new code.
 *   3. To force an in-flight job onto the new code: cancel it in
 *      the Inngest dashboard and re-invoke — Inngest treats that
 *      as a new submission and picks up the current function
 *      version.

  "Polish-25.8 Commit 53 - Gemini vision model swap (hotfix). Tester Eric hit 'model not available' error against gemini-2.5-flash. Root cause: Google slid the 2.5 generation into deprecation while the -latest alias kept resolving to the current-gen Flash text/vision model. Fix: packages/ai-providers/src/gemini-client.ts hardcoded VISION_MODEL='gemini-2.5-flash' -> new DEFAULT_GEMINI_VISION_MODEL='gemini-flash-latest' with GEMINI_VISION_MODEL env override for A/B testing or hard-pinning. -latest alias is Google's public commitment to keep resolving to a supported model, so future rotations won't need a code change. All 5 call sites in gemini-client.ts (Vision analyze, detect frame image, similarity check, JSON extraction, prompt condensing) now read visionModel() at call time so env changes take effect without a bot restart. Image model (Nano Banana 2, gemini-3.1-flash-image) untouched - already on current generation. Version bump: POLISH_VERSION 25.8.5 -> 25.8.6.";
