/**
 * Polish-21.0.15: single source of truth for the shipped Polish
 * version. Imported by:
 *
 *   - packages/jobs (worker → composite-row metadata + cold-start log)
 *   - apps/web `/api/health` (curl-verifiable freshness endpoint)
 *   - apps/web `/api/version` (dedicated version endpoint)
 *
 * A shared constant creates a cross-package import chain that MUST
 * rebuild every downstream when this file changes — no more "did
 * Vercel actually pick up the packages/jobs change?" guessing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — Polish-21.0.15 root-cause diagnostic
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Job 961281c5 showed `polish_version: null` on a failed RETRY
 * even though Vercel dashboard confirmed the Polish-21.0.14 SHA
 * (1065775) as deployed. Root cause was likely Inngest's
 * documented behavior: retries of an IN-FLIGHT job execute
 * against the function version that was live when the job was
 * FIRST invoked — not the currently-deployed version. So a job
 * originally submitted pre-Polish-21.0.14 keeps running the old
 * code on every retry.
 *
 * Diagnosis protocol for a "did the deploy stick?" report:
 *   1. Curl `/api/health` — reports POLISH_VERSION. If the value
 *      isn't the SHA-in-question, the deploy legitimately didn't
 *      stick (rare — check Vercel build logs).
 *   2. If /api/health shows the expected version but composite
 *      rows still say polish_version=null, submit a NEW job (not
 *      a retry). Inngest's frozen-version-per-job behavior means
 *      retries never see new code.
 *   3. To force an in-flight job onto the new code: cancel it in
 *      the Inngest dashboard and re-invoke — Inngest treats that
 *      as a new submission and picks up the current function
 *      version.

  'Polish-29.0.17 Commit 126 - fix: align Seedance submit with the REAL Dreamina docs (user pasted the API reference). Three corrections in one commit: (1) correct t2v ratio field is `ratio` (not aspectRatio / aspect_ratio / image); (2) correct i2v reference field is `firstFrameRef` (not image / image_url); (3) firstFrameRef value MUST be an imageRef string returned by POST /dreamina/assets/account - raw HTTP URLs are rejected. Adds a pre-Seedance upload step in the polish29 variations worker: after Nano Banana generates the character PNG, upload it to Dreamina to get the imageRef, then pass THAT to Seedance under firstFrameRef. When firstFrameRef is present ratio is auto-detected from the image and MUST NOT be sent. Also fixed the asset upload URL for Dreamina (/dreamina/assets/account not /dreamina/assets) and taught the response parser to read `imageRef` in addition to `assetId`.';
