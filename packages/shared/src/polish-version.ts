/**
 * Polish-21.0.15: single source of truth for the shipped Polish
 * version. Imported by:
 *
 *   - packages/jobs (worker → composite-row metadata + cold-start log)
 *   - apps/web `/api/health` (curl-verifiable freshness endpoint)
 *   - apps/web `/api/version` (dedicated version endpoint)
 *
 * A shared constant creates a cross-package import chain that MUST
 * rebuild every downstream when this file changes — no more "did
 * Vercel actually pick up the packages/jobs change?" guessing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — Polish-21.0.15 root-cause diagnostic
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Job 961281c5 showed `polish_version: null` on a failed RETRY
 * even though Vercel dashboard confirmed the Polish-21.0.14 SHA
 * (1065775) as deployed. Root cause was likely Inngest's
 * documented behavior: retries of an IN-FLIGHT job execute
 * against the function version that was live when the job was
 * FIRST invoked — not the currently-deployed version. So a job
 * originally submitted pre-Polish-21.0.14 keeps running the old
 * code on every retry.
 *
 * Diagnosis protocol for a "did the deploy stick?" report:
 *   1. Curl `/api/health` — reports POLISH_VERSION. If the value
 *      isn't the SHA-in-question, the deploy legitimately didn't
 *      stick (rare — check Vercel build logs).
 *   2. If /api/health shows the expected version but composite
 *      rows still say polish_version=null, submit a NEW job (not
 *      a retry). Inngest's frozen-version-per-job behavior means
 *      retries never see new code.
 *   3. To force an in-flight job onto the new code: cancel it in
 *      the Inngest dashboard and re-invoke — Inngest treats that
 *      as a new submission and picks up the current function
 *      version.

  "Polish-25.9 Commit 57 - Static ad picker silent-disable fix. Tester reported: click Static ad card, Generate button stays disabled with no visible reason. Investigation: the click IS registering (staticOpenaiSelected flips to true, canSubmit returns true), and the card renders its selected state (border thicker, checkmark visible). But hasProviderKey returns false when the user hasn't connected OpenAI, so the disabled attribute stays on. Root cause: the inline 'Connect your <keys>' nudge at apps/web/app/concepts/[id]/generate/simplified-form.tsx:445 gated on (modelId != null || polish23Selected || polish25Selected) - it MISSED staticOpenaiSelected. So a Static-ad picker without an OpenAI key showed a disabled button with zero inline explanation (the hover title tooltip is invisible on mobile + operator's hardware). Commit 55's 'Pick a pipeline above' hint also didn't fire because canSubmit was true. The result was a dead-end. Fix: added staticOpenaiSelected to the condition. Now the OpenAI-key-missing case surfaces the same 'Connect your OpenAI key on Settings -> Connections' link the other three pipeline pickers already surface. Version bump: POLISH_VERSION 25.8.9 -> 25.9.0 (minor bump on the fifth silent-disable-adjacent fix this cycle - warrants a new minor to break the debug-noise pattern).";
